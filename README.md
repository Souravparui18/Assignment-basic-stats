## Q3) Three Coins are tossed, find the probability that two heads and one tail are obtained?
Ans: P (Two heads and one tail) = N (Event (Two heads and one tail)) / N (Event (Three coins tossed)) = 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%

## Q4) Two Dice are rolled, find the probability where sum is
a) Equal to 1 b) Less than or equal to 4 c) Divisible by 2 and 3 Ans: Ans - n(S) = 36 (i) Event of the sum is equal to 1 = 0 A = 0 P(A) =0/n(S)=0 (ii) Event of the sum is less than or equal to 4 B={(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)(1,3),(2,2),(3,1)} n(B) = 6 P(B) = 6/36=1/6 or 0.16 (iii) Event of the sum is divisible by 2 and 3 C = {(1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1),(6,6)} n(C) = 6 P(C) = 6/36 = 1/6 or 0.16

## Q5) A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
Ans: Total number of balls = (2 + 3 + 2) = 7 Let S be the sample space. Then, n(S) = Number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of 7 =7C2 =(7×6)/(2x1) =21 Let E = Event of drawing 2 balls, none of which is blue. n(E)= Number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of (2 + 3) balls. =5C2 =(5×4)/(2x1) =10 P(E)=n(E)/n(S)=10/21 =0.476

## Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view) CHILD Candies count Probability A 1 0.015 B 4 0.20 C 3 0.65 D 5 0.005 E 6 0.01 F 2 0.120 Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015. Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20 Ans: Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child = 1 * 0.015 + 4*0.20 + 3 0.65 + 50.005 + 6 *0.01 + 2 * 0.12 = 0.015 + 0.8 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 3.090 = 3.09 Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child = 3.09

## Q8) Calculate Expected Value for the problem below
a) The weights (X) of patients at a clinic (in pounds), are 108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199 Assume one of the patients is chosen at random. What is the Expected Value of the Weight of that patient? Ans: Expected value = Sum (X * Probability of X) = (1/9)(108)+ (1/9)(110)+ (1/9)(123)+ (1/9)(134)+ (1/9)(145)+ (1/9)(167)+ (1/9)(187)+ (1/9)(199) = 145.33

## Q10) Draw inferences about the following boxplot & histogram
Ans: i)The following histogram is right skewwed , it means the majority of data is not normaly distributed and it may have outliers. (ii) The above boxplot shows that it has outliers in its data.

## Q12) Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests
34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56

Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation. Ans: Mean =41, Median =40.5, Variance =25.52 and Standard Deviation =5.05

What can we say about the student marks? Ans: we don’t have outliers and the data is slightly skewed towards right because mean is greater than median.

## Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean and median of data are equal?
Ans: No skewness is present we have a perfect symmetrical distribution

## Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?
Ans: Skewness and tail is towards Right

## Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
Ans: Skewness and tail is towards left

## Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?
Ans: Positive kurtosis means the curve is more peaked and it is Leptokurtic

## Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
Ans: Negative Kurtosis means the curve will be flatter and broader

## Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.
What can we say about the distribution of the data? Ans: The above Boxplot is not normally distributed the median is towards the higher value

What is nature of skewness of the data? Ans: The data is a skewed towards left. The whisker range of minimum value is greater than maximum

What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)? Ans: The Inter Quantile Range = Q3 Upper quartile – Q1 Lower Quartile = 18 – 10 =8

## Q19) Comment on the below Boxplot visualizations?
Draw an Inference from the distribution of data for Boxplot 1 with respect Boxplot 2. Ans: First there are no outliers. Second both the box plot shares the same median that is approximately in a range between 275 to 250 and they are normally distributed with zero to no skewness neither at the minimum or maximum whisker range.

## Q21) Check whether the data follows normal distribution
a) Check whether the MPG of Cars follows Normal Distribution Dataset: Cars.csv Ans: a.) MPG of cars follows normal distribution

b) Check Whether the Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist Circumference (Waist) from wc-at data set follows Normal Distribution Dataset: wc-at.csv Ans: Adipose Tissue (AT) and Waist does not follow Normal Distribution
